## 1. Scenario<a id='scenario'></a>
A system administrator reported to SOC that after downloading a technical document from an email, he suspected that the downloaded file might not have been from the legitimate vendor. He only realized this after he tried but could not open to read the document and thus, he immediately called the vendor directly to check if the file was broken. However, the vendor replied that they did not send any file to him during that time.
Upon SOC’s request, the system administrator provided the estimated time frame of which these events occurred.

### Key concerns from stakeholders: 
I. Could the file be a malware? What is it trying to do? <br>
II. Why did none of the cybersecurity technologies detected and stopped this? <br>
III. How to prevent this from happening? <br>
