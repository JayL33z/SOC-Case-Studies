# About SOC Case Study Reports
This repository primarily presents case studies of familiarity with security monitoring in SIEM-driven environment and the ability to investigate real-world attack techniques while following structured incident response procedures in a controlled lab environment to simulate SOC workflows.

The objective is to showcase SOC analyst skills from a defender’s perspective.

These projects aim to demonstrate end-to-end SOC workflows, including log collection, alert triage, threat analysis, incident validation, and response actions. Each investigation documents the analyst’s decision-making process, tools used, and evidence collected to identify real attacker behavior and determine scope/impact.

Disclaimer: *The below case studies are based on simulated scenarios. The organization, systems, data, and events described are entirely fictional and created for educational and portfolio purposes. The focus is not just to share how threats were detected in a network, but to provide review as to what defenders can investigate to determine true positives from false positives, and what they can do to remediate it.*
